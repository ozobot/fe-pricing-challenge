# Ozobot File Transfer pricing component

![Design preview for the File Transfer pricing component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for your interest in Ozobot

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this pricing component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. 

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- Control the toggle with both their mouse/trackpad and their keyboard
- **Bonus**: Complete the challenge with just HTML and CSS


## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to, as well as a design for the active states.

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
